### 0.2. Mockups (to be created)

For this MVP, we plan to create simple wireframes (e.g., in Figma) for the following **main screens**:

1. **Home / Movie Catalog Screen**
   - List of movies with poster, title, rating, and quick access to details.

2. **Movie Detail Screen**
   - Extended movie information (synopsis, genres, cast, average rating, streaming availability, platform links).
   - Section for user ratings and comments.
   - (Later) optional trailer and “add to favorites” button.

3. **Authentication Screens**
   - Login page (email/username + password).
   - Signup page (basic fields for account creation).

4. **Optional Community Screen (if implemented)**
   - Simple chat / forum layout to post and read short messages.

Links or images of these mockups will be added here once the wireframes are created.
