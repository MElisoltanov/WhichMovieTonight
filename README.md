##  Project Concept

Choosing a movie can quickly become frustrating due to:
- too many platforms
- too many choices
- scattered information

**WhichMovieTonight** provides a simple solution:  
👉 **a single platform** to quickly decide what to watch tonight.

---

##  Problem Statement

Users spend too much time browsing multiple platforms just to find a movie to watch.

---

##  Proposed Solution

A centralized web application that allows users to:

- Browse a **movie catalog**
- Read **community ratings and comments**
- Check **streaming availability**
- Access **direct links** to streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, etc.)

---

## Target Users

- Movie enthusiasts
- Casual viewers
- Streaming platform subscribers
- Anyone looking for quick movie recommendations

---

## Application Type

- Responsive Web Application
- Mobile-first
- Accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

---

## MVP Features

Core features planned for the first release:

- 🎞️ **Movie Catalog**  
  - Title, synopsis, genre, cast, average rating  
  - At least 200 movies

- 🔐 **User Accounts**  
  - Secure signup and login  
  - Authentication system

- ⭐ **Ratings & Comments**  
  - Authenticated users can rate and comment on movies

- 📺 **Streaming Availability**

---

## Optional Features (Post-MVP)

---

## Out of Scope Features

- AI-based recommendations
- Private messaging
- Friend system

---

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Unofficial API dependency** for streaming availability  
  → Mitigation: local caching and backend abstraction layer

- **Scope creep**  
  → Mitigation: strict MVP prioritization

- **Chat feature complexity**  
  → Mitigation: implemented only if time allows

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (framework to be defined)
- **Backend**: REST API
- **Database**: Relational database
- **External APIs**: Movie data & streaming availability
- **Authentication**: Sessions or JWT
